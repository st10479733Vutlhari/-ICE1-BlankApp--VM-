Counter Application

During the setup of the counter app project, i followed the required steps to configure visual studio and create
a new project. although i encountered some challenges to push the code i ended up resolving it. Overall, the process
helped me better understand project structure and improve my confidence in using Github.

The setup steps were: 
Open windows explorer
Open documents
Create a folder
Go inside the created folder and create another folder
Open visual studio code
Open terminal
Write npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript

This is a screenshot of the code and the app running
